# MovieAppVIP
### This movie application that I created using [OMDb Api](https://www.omdbapi.com/) is an application where you can search movies by name and bookmark your favorite movies.

## Usage
Movie App is a movie finder app. Search is made by typing a few words from the movie name in the search bar. In response, a list comes up with pictures, names and dates of the movies.  When one of the cells is clicked on the search view and the favorites view, it will take you to the details view. On the details view, there are details such as the summary of the movie and the imdb score
